# Startup 

Created a program that allows you to choose which files you do not want to open automatically when you start up your Windows OS Computer.

## Deployment

1. To run this program, download the file. Open command prompt and make sure you have python downloaded. You can do this by typing:

        python --version

You do not need to install winreg separately as it is included in your Python installation. 


2. Next, run the program by moving to the appropriate download folder in the command prompt. Use cd to change drives. Then type in the command prompt or terminal:



        Type:  python NameofFile.py


3. The program should run and open.

- Alternatively -
You can also copy and paste the code in the  [code file](###) after typing "python" and ENTER into a command prompt or Windows Powershell.
